# Changelog

All notable changes to idea-harness are recorded here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versioning is pre-1.0: the CLI surface, the HTTP API, and the on-disk config schema may change in
any release. Breaking changes are listed under **Changed** or **Removed** with the migration in the
entry itself. Once 1.0 ships, this project follows semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A clean checkout now compiles with no Node toolchain. `internal/web/dist/` was ignored by git while
  `internal/web/web.go` embeds it, so `go install ./cmd/idea`, `make test`, and `make vet` all failed
  in a fresh clone with `pattern dist: no matching files found`. A placeholder `dist/index.html` is
  committed; `make build` overwrites it with the real UI.

### Changed

- `README.md` no longer describes Node and pnpm as optional for installing. They are needed only to
  change the web UI.
